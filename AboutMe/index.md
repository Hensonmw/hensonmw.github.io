Born and raised in the Midwest, I came to the University of Chicago as a Postdoctoral Researcher in the <a href="http://biogeolabs.uchicago.edu/colemanlab/">Coleman Lab</a> from the <a href="https://thethrashlab.com/">Thrash lab</a> at the University of Southern California. I graduated with my Ph.D. in May of 2019 from LSU where my dissertation used high-throughput cultivation to help facilitate the genomic and physiological characterization of previously uncultivated and important marine/freshwater microbial clades. Our cultivation campaign resulted in the isolation of 13 novel genera and species, as well as numerous cultivars that have never before been isolated using <a href="https://msphere.asm.org/content/1/2/e00028-16">artificial media</a>. One of the most important cultivars obtained by these efforts, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-018-0092-2">SAR11 LD12</a> (Freshwater SAR11), was studied to determine the genomic and physiological traits associated with its distribution, as well as generate a hypothesis about the evolutionary transition between marine and freshwater habitats. I also helped lead research on how the biogeochemistry and stream order of the <a href="https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lno.10811"> Mississippi River</a> effected the surface water microbial community. Prior to my Ph.D., I received my Master's Degree from Central Michigan University in <a href="http://people.cst.cmich.edu/learm1dr/Home_Page.html">Dr. Deric Learman's lab</a>. My MS thesis investigated the genomic, physiological, and chromate reduction variation among <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.1395">four Microbacterium isolates</a>. While at the Learman lab, I also took part in projects on microbial ecology of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13213-015-1189-8">Poyang Lake (Nanchang, China) and the Great Lakes </a> and <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00284">the Antarctic shelf</a>.


Outside of the lab and office, I enjoy cooking, hiking, backpacking, scuba diving, and crossfit.
