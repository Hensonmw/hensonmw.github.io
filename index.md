**Hello and Welcome to my home page!**

_if you are looking for the Thrash Lab website click [HERE](thethrashlab.com)_

My name is Michael Henson and I am a fourth year graduate student in [Dr. Cameron Thrash's lab](thethrashlab.com) at [Louisiana State University](http://www.lsu.edu/science/biosci/).

Born and raised in the Midwest, I came to LSU and the Thrash lab from [Dr. Deric Learmanâ€™s lab](http://people.cst.cmich.edu/learm1dr/Home_Page.html) at Central Michigan University where I completed my MS thesis investigating genomic, physiological, and chromate reduction variation among four isolates [(here)](https://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.1395). While at the Learman lab, I was able to take part in projects at [Poyang Lake (Nanchang, China)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13213-015-1189-8), [the Antarctic shelf](https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00284), and in Great Lake coastal wetlands. Prior to my Master's, I spent a year in [Dr. Jorge Santo Domingo's lab](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jorge_Domingo) working as a student contractor. Together my research experiences have pulled me in many directions, but ultimately led me to develop a passion for research in environmental microbiology. Specifically, I use cultivation-dependent and -independent techniques to help inform our understanding on the evolutionary transition between freshwater and marine ecosystems and how both local and regional disturbances may alter biogeochemical cycling.
